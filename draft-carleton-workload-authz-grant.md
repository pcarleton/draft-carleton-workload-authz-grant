--- abstract

This document defines the Workload Authorization Grant (WAG), a mechanism
by which a workload hosted on a platform -- an AI agent being the motivating
case -- obtains access tokens from a third party's OAuth authorization
server without requiring an administrator to perform a per-workload
registration step.  Each
workload is identified by an opaque, non-reassignable identifier; it obtains
access tokens by presenting a JWT authorization grant (RFC 7523), signed by
the platform's per-tenancy issuer, in the assertion parameter at the
authorization server protecting the resource server.  Trust is established
once, by reference to the issuer's published metadata and keys; workload
creation requires no per-workload step at the authorization server or
resource server; and authorization is expressed over platform-asserted
properties that resource servers map locally to permissions.  This document
addresses workloads acting on their own behalf; access on behalf of a user
or other principal is out of scope, though the design is intended to compose
with existing delegation mechanisms in which the workload appears as the
actor.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Agent platforms host many agent instances per customer, created
and retired at the cadence at which the customer organizes its work -- per
channel, repository, or pipeline.  An individual agent may persist for weeks
or months, but the person creating it is typically not the person authorized
to provision credentials at the resource servers it will access.  Per-agent
credentials are therefore not issued in practice, and deployments collapse to
a single credential shared across all agents of an installation -- a pattern
the AI agent authentication and authorization framework {{AIMS}}, Section 7,
identifies as an antipattern -- at the cost of any attribution of an
individual agent's actions at the resource server.

Existing workload identity federation {{WIMSE-ARCH}} addresses an analogous
problem between an organization's workloads and infrastructure providers, but
its claim and policy semantics are defined per provider rather than portably,
and it has not been applied between agent platforms and SaaS resource
servers.  The Model Context Protocol's proposed Workload Identity Federation
extension {{MCP-WIF}} defines the corresponding wire mechanics for MCP servers; this
document is intended to be interoperable with it.

This document specifies a mechanism for that deployment pattern, the
Workload Authorization Grant (WAG): a platform-signed JWT authorization
grant asserting a workload's identity and platform-asserted properties,
presented at the token endpoint of an authorization server that has been
configured, once, to trust the platform's issuer.  Thereafter workloads are
accepted on first presentation with no per-workload registration step.
Agent platforms are the motivating deployment, and the terminology
throughout uses "Agent"; the mechanism itself is not agent-specific and
applies to any platform hosting workloads that need federated access to
third-party resource servers.  This document builds on
the OAuth JWT authorization grant {{RFC7523}} and on published issuer
metadata, and it can be implemented without reference to any other agent
identity framework.  Readers arriving from the AI agent authentication
and authorization framework {{AIMS}} will find how this mechanism relates to that document's
conceptual model in {{aims}}.

A design goal of this document is a minimal adoption path for services that
already operate an OAuth deployment: supporting it requires changes only at
the authorization server's token endpoint, which accepts the JWT
authorization grant from registered issuers.  The access tokens the
authorization server issues are unchanged in format and semantics, and
resource servers continue to trust their authorization server exactly as
they do today.

## Scope

In scope: agents acting on their own behalf.  Out of scope: on-behalf-of
access, legacy integration via static credentials, runtime attestation,
agent-to-agent protocols.  This document deliberately does not specify
on-behalf-of flows; the design is intended to compose with
delegation mechanisms in which the agent appears as the actor rather than
the subject (e.g., the act claim and actor_token parameter of {{RFC8693}},
or {{IDJAG}}), and that composition is left to future documents.

# Conventions and Terminology {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Agent Platform ("Platform"):
: The service that hosts Agents and operates the per-tenancy issuers that
  vouch for them.

Agent:
: A hosted workload with its own Agent Identifier, context, and
  configuration.

Agent Property:
: A Platform-asserted attribute carried as a claim in the authorization
  grant.

Authorization Server (AS):
: The OAuth authorization server at which Agents present authorization
  grants and obtain access tokens; commonly, but not necessarily, operated
  by the same vendor as the Resource Server it protects.

Resource Server (RS):
: The service holding customer resources, accessed with the access tokens
  the Authorization Server issues.

Enterprise IdP:
: The customer's identity provider (optional).

Customer Administrator:
: The human who performs one-time trust establishment by registering the
  Platform's issuer at the Authorization Server ({{trust}}).

Tenancy:
: One customer's administrative boundary at a party.  At the Platform, a
  tenancy is the set of Agents one customer controls together with the
  issuer that signs assertions about them; at the Authorization Server
  and Resource Server, it is that customer's account there, within which
  issuer registrations are held.  Where the side matters, this document
  says "Platform tenancy" or "the customer's tenancy at the Authorization
  Server".

Issuer Registration ("registration"):
: The record a Customer Administrator creates at an Authorization Server
  so that it accepts Workload Authorization Grants from one issuer for the
  Agents of one Platform tenancy ({{trust}}).  The administrator
  "registers the issuer"; an issuer so recorded is a "registered issuer".
  In this document a registration holds the issuer identifier and the
  tenancy's initial Property-to-permission mapping ({{properties}}); it
  is also the scope within which the Authorization Server holds the
  issuer's keys and interprets `sub` and `jti`.  An issuer registration
  is not an OAuth client registration {{RFC7591}}: it is made by
  reference to the issuer's published metadata, and the Authorization
  Server issues no client identifier or credential in return.

# Concepts

## Overview {#overview}

The mechanism involves the following parties.  The Agent Platform hosts
Agents and operates, for each customer tenancy, an issuer that signs
assertions about that tenancy's Agents; each Agent presents its own
assertion to the Authorization Server.  The Authorization Server
protects a Resource Server and issues the access tokens the Resource
Server accepts.  The Customer Administrator holds the authority, within
a customer tenancy, to configure the Authorization Server to trust that
tenancy's issuer.

The mechanism has three steps, of which only the last recurs
({{fig-overview}}):

1. Trust establishment, once per tenancy ({{trust}}): the Customer
   Administrator records at the Authorization Server that assertions from
   the tenancy's issuer are accepted, identifying the issuer by its issuer
   identifier.  The Authorization Server discovers the issuer's keys from
   its published metadata; nothing is exchanged out of band.
2. Agent instantiation, per Agent ({{instantiation}}): the Platform creates
   an Agent and assigns it an Agent Identifier.  Nothing happens at the
   Authorization Server or Resource Server.
3. Token request, per access ({{workload-authorization-grant}}): the Agent
   presents a Workload Authorization Grant -- a JWT signed by the tenancy's
   issuer, naming the Agent as its subject and carrying the Agent's
   Properties -- as the authorization grant in an ordinary OAuth token
   request.  The Authorization Server validates the signature against the
   registered issuer's keys, accepts the Agent whether or not it has seen
   the Agent Identifier before, and issues an access token whose format and
   semantics are unchanged.

## Agent Identity Model {#identity-model}

An Agent's identity has three units: the issuer, which signs assertions
about the Agent; the Agent Identifier, carried as the
assertion's `sub` ({{workload-authorization-grant}}); and claims, carrying
everything else ({{properties}}).  The Agent Identifier is opaque and
immutable.  It MUST be unique within its issuer, the Platform's per-tenancy
issuer ({{trust}}), and hence within that tenancy -- the (`iss`, `sub`) rule
of {{Section 3.1 of IDJAG}} for a single-tenant issuer.  It MUST NOT be
reassigned to a different Agent;
where the identifier is a Workload Identifier, this tightens the SHOULD NOT
of {{Section 4.5 of WIMSE-ID}}, because Resource Servers key durable records
(policy, audit, grants) on it.  Renaming an Agent -- changing its name
Property ({{properties}}) or any other display label -- MUST NOT change its
Agent Identifier.  Agent Identifiers are compared as case-sensitive strings with
no transformations or canonicalizations applied ({{Section 2 of RFC7519}},
StringOrURI); a URI-form identifier is compared as the complete URI
({{Section 4.3 of WIMSE-ID}}), with no prefix or wildcard matching
({{Section 7.6 of WIMSE-ID}}).  Resource Servers MUST NOT parse or
pattern-match the Agent Identifier for authorization; single-agent policy is
an exact match on the `sub` value.

The Agent Identifier MAY be, and is RECOMMENDED to be, a Workload
Identifier URI {{WIMSE-ID}} with an opaque path; a bare opaque string is also
permitted.  When the Agent Identifier
is a URI, the Authorization Server validates its authority component against
the registered issuer's tenancy once, at token issuance; Resource Servers
treat the complete identifier as an opaque, exact-match string regardless of
form and MUST NOT derive trust from its components.

## Relationship to AIMS {#aims}

{{AIMS}} describes a framework for authentication and authorization of AI
agents, with a conceptual model in which agents are treated as workloads with
identifiers, credentials, and authorization.  This document is not a
profile of {{AIMS}} and does not depend on it: nothing in {{AIMS}} is
normative here, and where terminology overlaps, the definitions in
{{conventions}} govern.  This section is informative; it exists so that a
reader who knows {{AIMS}} can see where this mechanism sits in its model.

In {{AIMS}} terms, WAG is one concrete answer for the case of an agent
acting on its own behalf ({{AIMS}}, Section 10.4.2), in which the agent is a
hosted workload and the platform that hosts it is the authority that vouches
for it.  The correspondences are:

| AIMS concept | In this document |
|---|---|
| Agent identifier (Sec. 6) | The Agent Identifier ({{identity-model}}): opaque, immutable, non-reassignable, scoped to its issuer, carried as `sub` |
| Agent credentials (Sec. 7) and authentication (Sec. 9) | The Platform's per-tenancy issuer signs an {{RFC7523}} JWT authorization grant on the Agent's behalf ({{workload-authorization-grant}}); OAuth client identity is deliberately unspecified |
| Credential provisioning (Sec. 8) | Platform-internal ({{instantiation}}); the Authorization Server learns of an Agent at first presentation |
| Authorization (Sec. 10) | Platform-asserted Agent Properties mapped locally to permissions ({{properties}}), under trust established once by reference ({{trust}}) |
| Monitoring and remediation (Sec. 11) | Attribution by (`iss`, `sub`) and `jti`; retirement by cessation ({{lifecycle}}); open items in {{oi}} |

The shared-credential antipattern that {{AIMS}}, Section 7, describes is
the deployment this mechanism is designed to replace ({{introduction}}).

## Relationship to WIMSE and SPIFFE

TODO.  A reader arriving from WIMSE or SPIFFE will ask where the Workload
Identity Token and the SPIFFE ID are in this design.  Explain: why the
assertion is an {{RFC7523}} authorization grant rather than a WIMSE WIT;
how the Agent Identifier's RECOMMENDED {{WIMSE-ID}} URI form relates to a
SPIFFE ID; and what changes if the Platform's issuer is backed by a
SPIFFE/WIMSE-style workload identity plane rather than operated as a
standalone OAuth issuer.

# Workload Authorization Grant

The Agent obtains access tokens from the Authorization Server by
presenting a JWT as an authorization grant per {{RFC7523}},
Section 2.1, issued by the Platform as a third party in the sense of
{{RFC7521}}, Section 3.  The token request carries
`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`, the JWT in the
assertion parameter, and the target resource in the resource parameter
{{RFC8707}}.  This document deliberately does not specify the OAuth client
identity or attach semantics to `client_id`.  In the simplest deployment the
token request is made without client authentication.  Deployments MAY layer
client authentication on top -- for example, the Platform authenticating as
an OAuth client in its own right with a Client ID Metadata Document {{CIMD}}
and a `private_key_jwt` client assertion -- a composition that becomes natural
when the authorization grant's issuer is the customer's Enterprise IdP
rather than the Platform (obtained, e.g., by token exchange {{RFC8693}} with
the IdP).  This document intentionally leaves that composition open rather
than fully specifying it ({{oi}}).

## JWT Syntax {#authorization-grant-claims}

The following claims are used within the Workload Authorization Grant JWT:

`iss`:
: REQUIRED - The issuer identifier of the Platform's per-tenancy issuer
  ({{trust}}).

`sub`:
: REQUIRED - The Agent Identifier as defined in {{identity-model}}.

`aud`:
: REQUIRED. The value SHOULD include both the Authorization Server's
  issuer identifier and its token endpoint URL; an Authorization Server
  accepting Workload Authorization Grants MUST accept an assertion whose `aud` includes either
  value ({{RFC7523}} itself leaves the audience strings to out-of-band
  configuration).  {{RFC7523BIS}} adds the issuer identifier as an audience
  option for authorization grants (while restricting client-authentication
  assertions, a different slot, to it alone); carrying both values keeps an
  assertion valid across deployed and future processing.

`jti`:
: REQUIRED - Unique ID of this JWT as defined in {{Section 4.1.7 of RFC7519}}.

`exp`:
: REQUIRED - as defined in {{Section 4.1.4 of RFC7519}}.

`iat`:
: REQUIRED - as defined in {{Section 4.1.6 of RFC7519}}.

The assertion is signed under a key in
the issuer's published JWK Set {{RFC7517}}.  The Authorization Server MUST
resolve the signing key by iss ({{trust}}), not via a client registration.
The assertion carries the Agent's Properties ({{properties}}), and the
Authorization Server MUST make them available to the Resource Server's
authorization decision.

An Agent Property records what the Platform asserted when it issued the
authorization grant.  The grant's signature authenticates that assertion;
`iat` records when it was made, and `exp` bounds how long the grant can be
accepted.  Those checks do not by themselves establish that a mutable
Property remains true when the grant is presented or when an access token is
used.  If a local authorization rule requires a Property to remain true at
one of those later times, the deployment MUST obtain evidence current for
that time.  Otherwise, the deployment MUST bound its exposure to stale
Properties through the grant and access token lifetimes.

Authorization Servers accepting Workload Authorization Grants MUST
include `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` in `grant_types_supported`
in their metadata {{RFC8414}}.

The Authorization Server MUST NOT issue refresh tokens, as access tokens are short-lived and
audience-restricted {{RFC8707}}.  Assertion lifetimes SHOULD be as short as
system availability constraints allow.

TODO: proof-of-possession -- the assertion is a bearer grant; options are
sender-constrained access tokens, or attestation-based client authentication
{{ATTEST-CLIENT-AUTH}} (Platform as client attester, agent instance signs the
PoP JWT) if agent instances hold keys.

# Deployment

{{overview}} shows the three steps end to end: one-time trust establishment
by the Customer Administrator ({{trust}}); agent creation by end users with
no interaction with the Resource Server ({{instantiation}}); and the
per-request JWT authorization grant ({{workload-authorization-grant}}).
This section specifies the first two and the authorization model that
connects them.

## Trust Establishment {#trust}

The Customer Administrator once records, at the Authorization Server, an
issuer registration binding one issuer to one tenancy: the issuer identifier, from which
the issuer's metadata and JWK Set location are discovered per
{{OIDC-DISCOVERY}} (retrieved over https {{RFC9525}}), and the tenancy's initial
Property-to-permission mapping for the Resource Server ({{properties}}).  Establishment is by
reference; no keys or secrets are transferred, and key rotation is by JWK Set
update alone.  Platforms serving multiple customers MUST use a distinct
issuer per tenancy: the issuer is the trust boundary the registration expresses,
and a shared issuer would move tenancy enforcement into claim evaluation at
every Authorization Server -- including relying parties that can evaluate
only subject and audience ({{oi}}).  The proposed MCP Workload Identity
Federation extension {{MCP-WIF}} recommends (SHOULD) that authorization
servers rely only on issuing keys bound to a single tenant; this document deliberately tightens that boundary to a
per-tenancy issuer MUST.

An issuer registration is durable: it is held at the Authorization Server, only
the Customer Administrator can remove it, and it outlives the tenancy it
names if that tenancy ends at the Platform.  The issuer identifier of a
per-tenancy issuer MUST therefore be assigned by the Platform, MUST remain
stable for the life of the tenancy, and MUST NOT be reassigned to another
tenancy after that tenancy ends.  A Platform that derives the identifier
from a customer-chosen name (a workspace slug, an organization subdomain)
MUST NOT release that name for reuse by another customer: reassignment
would hand the new customer every issuer registration the old one held, at
every Authorization Server, with no way for the Platform to find or clear
them.  The same rule covers the authority component of a URI-form Agent
Identifier ({{identity-model}}), which carries the same tenancy.

Multi-issuer operation is scoped by issuer throughout.  An Authorization
Server MUST resolve and cache keys per issuer registration and MUST NOT merge
key sets across issuers, and it MUST interpret `sub` and `jti` only within
the scope of the presenting `iss`.  A Resource Server that keeps a
Property-to-permission mapping ({{properties}}) likewise scopes it by
`iss`.  An Agent Identifier is unique within the issuer registration that
admits it, not globally.  Policy, audit, and grant records MUST be keyed on
that registration's scope plus `sub` -- the (`iss`, `sub`) pair -- and MUST NOT be
keyed on `sub` alone; a complete URI-form identifier whose authority
component identifies the tenancy ({{identity-model}}) is an equivalent key.

## Agent Instantiation {#instantiation}

Creating an Agent is Platform-internal and MUST NOT require any
ahead-of-time interaction with the Resource Server, the Authorization
Server, an Enterprise IdP, or the Customer Administrator.  The Authorization
Server first learns that an Agent exists when the Agent presents its first
authorization grant: it MUST accept a previously-unseen Agent Identifier
presented as sub under a registered issuer, and authorization -- at the
Authorization Server and the Resource Server alike -- is via {{properties}},
never identifier structure.  Agents are not
dynamically registered clients {{RFC7591}}.

Optionally, a Platform MAY project Agents into an Enterprise IdP (e.g., as
{{SCIM-AGENT}} resources) for inventory and lifecycle governance.  Such
projection MUST NOT be required ahead of time: performing it just in time,
including synchronously during first token issuance, is acceptable.  TODO:
BYO-IdP deployment model.

## Agent Properties and Authorization {#properties}

TODO.  Initial standard property claims: name, a human-readable display
name as in an OpenID Connect ID Token {{OIDC-CORE}} (mutable, and never a
key for authorization or attribution -- that is the Agent Identifier);
namespace, groups, roles, and an optional ctx naming the collaboration
context; additional attributes use collision-resistant claim names per
{{RFC7519}}, Section 4.3.  TODO: whether an Agent needs a human-usable,
"@"-referenceable address within the Platform, analogous to sharing a
document with an email address, distinct from both name and the opaque
Agent Identifier; noted here, deliberately unsolved.  A Resource
Server keeps a local, administrator-controlled mapping from Property
predicates to permissions; possession of a Property is not itself
authorization.  Property names and values cross a trust boundary as
issuer assertions, not as portable permission assignments.  A Resource
Server MUST interpret them under its own issuer-scoped mapping and MUST NOT
assume that a role, group, entitlement, or similarly named value has the
same meaning in another issuer's domain.  Deny semantics do not travel.
TODO: worked example.

## Attribution

TODO.  The Authorization Server logs jti at token issuance; Resource
Servers log the Agent Identifier (sub) and referenced Properties; internal fan-out via {{TXN-TOKENS}} rather than
forwarding the access token.

## Retirement and Lifecycle {#lifecycle}

Retirement is expressed by cessation: the Platform stops signing assertions
for a retired Agent, so residual access is bounded by the remaining lifetime
of any outstanding assertion plus the lifetime of any access token already
issued.  Assertion and access-token lifetimes SHOULD be chosen with this
bound in mind.  No signal yet informs an Authorization Server that an Agent
Identifier is permanently retired; that gap is shared with neighboring
workload identity ecosystems, whose common baseline is likewise short
credential lifetimes plus ceasing issuance ({{oi}}).

Broader lifecycle management is out of scope for this document.  In
particular, resources that come to be owned by an Agent (documents, records,
long-lived artifacts) need succession planning when the Agent is retired;
this document makes the retirement event's access consequences legible, but
does not manage its downstream effects.

# Open Issues {#oi}

- Relying parties that authorize only on subject and audience (e.g., cloud
  IAM federation trust policies) and cannot evaluate Property predicates;
  URI-form Agent Identifiers ({{identity-model}}) carry the tenancy inside
  the identifier for this case, but the residual gap is unassessed.
- Proof-of-possession: the authorization grant is bearer; see
  {{workload-authorization-grant}}.
- Issuer placement: issuer operated by the Platform versus by the Enterprise
  IdP, with the Platform obtaining assertions by token exchange {{RFC8693}}
  with the IdP; client authentication is redundant in the former case and
  load-bearing in the latter; what, if anything, client_id means in each
  case.
- Staleness and retirement signaling in place of per-agent revocation
  (issuer- or Property-scoped epoch versus event push versus lifetime
  alone, {{lifecycle}}); a gap shared with neighboring workload identity
  ecosystems.
- Addressing: whether an Agent needs a human-usable, "@"-referenceable
  address (to share a resource with an agent the way one shares with an
  email address), distinct from the display name and the Agent Identifier.

# Privacy Considerations

# Security Considerations

TODO: unseen agent identifiers under trusted issuers; issuer registration as the
trust boundary; tenant confusion at multi-issuer Authorization Servers ({{trust}});
bearer-assertion theft and assertion lifetime; Platform as root of trust;
credential non-exposure to the model; automated trust establishment.

Property freshness is distinct from JWT validity.  A valid signature proves
that the Platform made the assertion, while `exp` only limits how long the
grant may be accepted.  Neither proves that mutable runtime, posture, group,
role, or entitlement state still holds at presentation or access time.  A
deployment that authorizes on such state needs a current-status mechanism or
lifetimes short enough for its risk bound.  Failure to obtain required
current-status evidence MUST NOT be treated as evidence that the Property
still holds.
